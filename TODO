* Test current setup on two machines and verify latency
* Reinstall my pi4 and and print a box
* Update gaia.c
  thread 1: listen on udp and write to jitter buffer
  thread 2: read from jitter buffer and write to speaker
            NOTE: Here we start to use the jitter buffer
  thread 3: write from mic and write to udp
  * Test jitter buffer with kernel tc tool
  * Use mutexes (lock free is the hype, see below)  
* Update gaia.c
  thread 1: listen on udp and write to jitter buffers (many)
  thread 2: read from jitter buffer (many) and write to speaker
  thread 3: write from mic and write to udp (many)
* UDP hole punching server
* Extend hole punching server with HLR functionality
* Encrypt streams
* Use libopus as as audio codec (variable payload)

Look into:

* Adaptive jitter buffer
  * Lock free jitter buffer?
  * Memory pool needed?

Hype:

* No tech
* Real-time communication
* Gaia
* PinePhone without screen
* Spotify merging
* Video feed (glasses/3ps)
* HLR/GPS routing ala Tony
* Speech pattern recognition
  * Beep when connected
* Fabulous Five concept
* The concept og love
* Take message if user is occupied
* Weeks of battery time:
  * Wake on LAN
  * Wake on speech
* Settings
  * Web based
  * Different access for different users
  * Group listings
